3. **Write the Script**: Write a Python script that reads the data from the CSV file, fills in the placeholders in the letter template, and sends the letters via email.

4. **Test the Script**: Run the script with a small subset of data to ensure it works as expected.

5. **Run the Script**: Once you're confident the script is working correctly, run it with the full data set.
